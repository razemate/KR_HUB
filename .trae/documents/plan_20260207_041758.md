I understand your frustration. The automatic Vercel CLI connection to GitHub is not working as expected because the repository `KR_HUB` does not exist on your GitHub account yet, so Vercel can't "see" it to connect.

I will perform the only action I can to help you connect it: **Ensure your local code is fully ready to be pushed.**

Since I cannot log in to your GitHub or Vercel dashboard to click buttons for you, you must perform these two manual steps to finish the connection:

1.  **Create the Repo Manually:** Go to https://github.com/new and create a repo named `KR_HUB`.
2.  **Push the Code:** Run `git push -u origin main` in your terminal.

Once you do that, the "Connect Git Repository" button in Vercel (your screenshot) will work.

I will now verify your local git remote one last time to ensure it is 100% correct so the push command works instantly for you.
