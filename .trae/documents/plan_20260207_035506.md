I will explain why the app is showing that specific "Action Required" message and then fix the Vercel 404 error you encountered.

### 1. Explanation: "Why the reply is like that?"
The message in your screenshot ("Action Required: Your schema cache needs updating...") is **custom logic I added** to handle the `PGRST205` error.
*   **The Problem:** You created new tables in Supabase, but the Supabase API (PostgREST) hasn't "noticed" them yet. It still thinks they don't exist.
*   **The Solution:** The app detected this specific error and, instead of crashing, is telling you exactly what to do: **Click "Reload schema cache" in your Supabase Dashboard settings.** Once you do that *one time*, the app will work perfectly.

### 2. Fix Vercel 404 Error
To fix the "404: NOT_FOUND" on Vercel, I need to tell Vercel how to handle your Python backend and React frontend together.

*   **Create `vercel.json`:** I will add a configuration file to the project root that defines:
    *   **Rewrites:** Route `/docs` and `/openapi.json` to the backend.
    *   **API Routes:** Route `/modules/*` and `/ai/*` to the Python backend.
    *   **Frontend:** Route everything else to the React app (so standard navigation works).
*   **Update `backend/main.py`:** Ensure the Python path is correctly set so imports work in the cloud environment.
*   **Redeploy:** Push the changes to Vercel.
