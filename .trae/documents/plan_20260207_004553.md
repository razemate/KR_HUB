I have diagnosed the latency issue and the "Empty Database" response.

**Diagnosis:**
1.  **Latency**: The backend logs confirm that **Gemini is failing** (`404 models/gemini-pro is not found`). This causes the system to wait for the timeout/error before switching to the Fallback (OpenRouter). This "failover time" is perceived as latency by the user.
    *   *Reason*: The model name `gemini-pro` might be deprecated or incorrect for the `google-generativeai` library version.
2.  **Empty Database**: The user asked about "woocommerce subscribers", but the system defaulted to querying the `profiles` table (which has 0 rows or irrelevant data).
    *   *Fix*: I've already updated the backend to detect keywords like "subscriber" or "woo", but since we don't know the exact schema, it might still fail if the table name isn't exactly 'subscribers'.

**The Plan:**
1.  **Fix Latency (Primary Provider)**:
    *   Update `core/ai_gateway.py` to use `gemini-1.5-flash` (faster, newer) instead of `gemini-pro`.
    *   If that fails, I will temporarily make OpenRouter the *primary* to ensure speed for this demo.
2.  **Fix "Empty Database" (Schema Awareness)**:
    *   I will add a step to **fetch the list of all tables** from Supabase (`information_schema`) *before* querying.
    *   The backend will then pick the *correct* table name (e.g., `wp_users`, `woocommerce_orders`) instead of guessing.
3.  **Optimize Prompt**:
    *   I will instruct the AI to be concise and fast.

I will implement these changes now to ensure the next "hi" is instant.
