I will fix the Vercel configuration immediately as requested.

### 1. Update `vercel.json`
I will modify `vercel.json` to explicitly point the static build output to `frontend/dist`. The previous configuration assumed the `dist` folder would be found automatically, but since the frontend is in a subdirectory (`frontend/`), Vercel needs to be told exactly where to look for the built assets.

### 2. Redeploy
I will run `vercel deploy --prod` again.

### 3. Verify
I will confirm the deployment URL is active.
