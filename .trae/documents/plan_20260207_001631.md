I found the issue! The error "Sorry, I couldn't process that" is happening because the backend is returning a **404 Not Found** error.

**Root Cause:**
In `backend/main.py`, the code to load the `chat_with_data` module was commented out (I left it as an "optional" feature in the initial setup). This means the API endpoint `/modules/chat-with-data/analyze` **does not exist**, so the frontend can't reach it.

**The Fix:**
I will explicitly connect the Chat module to the main application. This is the "professional" way to do it (explicit imports are better than magic dynamic loading).

**Plan:**
1.  **Update `backend/main.py`**: Import and include the `chat_with_data` router so the API endpoint becomes active.
2.  **Restart Backend**: Ensure the server reloads with the new route and the recently installed dependencies (`python-multipart` for file uploads).
3.  **Verify**: I will check the logs to confirm the endpoint is loaded and ready to serve requests.

This will fix the 404 error and allow the chat to work as intended.
