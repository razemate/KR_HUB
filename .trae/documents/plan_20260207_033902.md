I will create and run a diagnostic script to check the `public.subscribers` table and generate the detailed JSON report you requested.

## 1. Create Diagnostic Script (`diagnose_subscribers.py`)
I will write a Python script that uses the Supabase client to:
*   Attempt to fetch data from the `subscribers` table.
*   **Check for Errors:** Specifically catch `PGRST205` (Schema Cache/Missing Table) and other permission errors.
*   **Verify Schema:** Check for the `status` column and its values.
*   **Collect Stats:** Count total rows and "active" status rows.
*   **Generate Troubleshooting SQL:** If access fails, I will generate the exact SQL statements you requested (checking existence, enabling RLS, resetting schema cache).
*   **Generate Example Code:** Create the specific JavaScript and HTTP fetch snippets with your project URL.
*   **Format Output:** Produce the final result as a strict JSON object matching your specifications.

## 2. Execute Diagnosis
I will run the script to perform the check against your project `invhetvtoqibaogwodrx`.

## 3. Report Findings
I will output the generated JSON report, which will either contain your data samples or the precise SQL commands you need to run in your Dashboard to fix the access issues.
